These four Grand Slams differ in the composition of the court surfaces, when they are played in the year, and which city hosts the players. Individual Grand Slams come with different expectations, and it is often thought that some players achieve better results at some Grand Slams than others. It is also thought that differences in results may be attributed, at least partially, to surface type of the courts. For example, Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer, and Serena Williams have achieved their best results on clay, grass, and hard courts, respectively. This paper explores differences among Grand Slams, while adjusting for confounders such as tour, competitor strength, and player attributes. More specifically, we examine the effect of the Grand Slam on player performance for matches from 2013 to 2019. We take two approaches to modeling these data: (1) a mixed-effects model accounting for both player and tournament features and (2) models that emphasize individual performance. We identify differences across the Grand Slams at both the tournament and individual player level."

With the introduction of player tracking data from the NFL, researchers can now tackle these problems. However, event and strategy annotations in the NFL’s tracking data are limited, especially when it comes to describing what defensive players do on each play. Moreover, methods for creating these annotations typically require extensive human labeling, which is difficult and expensive. Because of the importance of the passing game and the limited prior research on the defensive side of passing, we provide annotations for the pass coverage types of cornerbacks using unsupervised learning techniques, which require no training data. We define a set of features from the tracking data that distinguish between “man” and “zone” coverage. We use mixture models to create clusters corresponding to each group, allowing us to provide probabilistic assignments to each coverage type (or cluster). Additionally, we quantify each feature’s influence in distinguishing defensive pass coverage types. Our work makes possible several potential avenues of future NFL research into defensive backs and pass coverage strategies."

However, current tackling metrics are manually recorded outcomes that are inherently flawed due to their discrete and subjective nature. Using player tracking data, we present a novel framework for assessing tackling contribution in a continuous and objective manner. Our approach first identifies when a defender is in a ``contact window’’ of the ball-carrier during a play, before assigning value to each window and the players involved. This enables us to devise a new metric called fractional tackles, which credits defenders for halting the ball-carrier’s forward motion toward the end zone. We demonstrate that fractional tackles overcome the shortcomings of traditional metrics such as tackles and assists, by providing greater variation and measurable information for players lacking recorded statistics like defensive linemen. We view our contribution as a significant step forward in measuring defensive performance in American football and a clear demonstration of the capabilities of player tracking data."

Existing metrics for assessing pass rush performance are either discrete-time quantities or based on subjective judgment. Using player tracking data, we propose STRAIN, a novel metric for evaluating pass rushers in the National Football League (NFL) at the continuous-time within-play level. Inspired by the concept of strain rate in materials science, STRAIN is a simple and interpretable means for measuring defensive pressure in football. It is a directly observed statistic as a function of two features: the distance between the pass rusher and QB, and the rate at which this distance is being reduced. Our metric possesses great predictability of pressure and stability over time. We also fit a multilevel model for STRAIN to understand the defensive pressure contribution of every pass rusher at the play-level. We apply our approach to NFL data and present results for the first eight weeks of the 2021 regular season. In particular, we provide comparisons of STRAIN for different defensive positions and play outcomes, and rankings of the NFL’s best pass rushers according to our metric."

Although the raw form of this data is not publicly available, the NFL releases a set of aggregated statistics via their Next Gen Stats (NGS) platform. They also provide charts showing the locations of pass attempts and outcomes for individual quarterbacks. Our work aims to partially close the gap between what data is available privately (to NFL teams) and publicly, and our contribution is two-fold. First, we introduce an image processing tool designed specifically for extracting the raw data from the NGS pass charts. We extract the pass outcome, coordinates, and other metadata. Second, we analyze the resulting dataset, examining the spatial tendencies and performances of individual quarterbacks and defenses. We use a generalized additive model for completion percentages by field location. We introduce a naive Bayes approach for estimating the 2-D completion percentage surfaces of individual teams and quarterbacks, and we provide a one-number summary, completion percentage above expectation (CPAE), for evaluating quarterbacks and team defenses. We find that our pass location data closely matches the NFL’s tracking data, and that our CPAE metric closely matches the NFL’s proprietary CPAE metric."

In American football, only discrete-time estimates of play value were possible, since the most advanced public football datasets were recorded at the play-by-play level. While measures such as expected points and win probability are useful for evaluating football plays and game situations, there has been no research into how these values change throughout the course of a play. In this work, we make two main contributions: First, we introduce a general framework for continuous-time within-play valuation in the National Football League using player-tracking data. Our modular framework incorporates several modular sub-models, to easily incorporate recent work involving player tracking data in football. Second, we use a long short-term memory recurrent neural network to construct a ball-carrier model to estimate how many yards the ball-carrier is expected to gain from their current position, conditional on the locations and trajectories of the ball-carrier, their teammates and opponents. Additionally, we demonstrate an extension with conditional density estimation so that the expectation of any measure of play value can be calculated in continuous-time, which was never before possible at such a granular level."

This paper investigates the aging curves for offensive players in Major League Baseball. We study this problem in a missing data context and account for different types of dropouts of baseball players during their careers. We employ a multiple imputation framework for multilevel data to impute the player performance associated with the missing seasons, and estimate the aging curves based on the imputed datasets. We then evaluate the effects of different dropout mechanisms on the aging curves through simulation, before applying our method to analyze MLB player data from past seasons. Results suggest an overestimation of the aging curves constructed without considering the unobserved seasons, whereas estimates obtained from multiple imputation address this shortcoming."

This happens, for instance, when mediocre players move into the top ten, and superstars fall out of the top 100. These occasional outliers hurt the credibility of APM, and mask the benefits, such as increased prediction accuracy. We address this problem with a new method, called Augmented APM. Augmented APM incorporates external player ratings into APM methodology. The purpose of the external rating system is to capture common sense player value. Augmented APM maintains the benefits of APM, and improves credibility by leveraging external ratings that pass the eye test. The key technical idea is recasting APM into a Bayesian framework and using external ratings in the prior distribution. This paper instantiates the Augmented APM method by applying it to soccer. APM methods have not had a substantial impact on soccer, because soccer matches are low scoring, with a low number of substitutions. For external ratings, we use the video game FIFA, which provides subjective evaluations from thousands of scouts, coaches, and season ticket holders. Our paper shows that Augmented APM predicts match outcomes better than (1) APM, and (2) FIFA ratings. We also show that Augmented APM de-correlates players on the same team, which helps for players that play most of their minutes together. Although our results are specific to soccer and FIFA ratings, Augmented APM is a principled method to combine subjective and objective ratings into a single system."

Existing methods such as the famous “plus/minus” statistic have many shortcomings. Standard linear regression methods work well when player substitutions are relatively uncommon and scoring events are relatively common, such as in basketball, but as neither of these conditions exists for hockey, we use an approach that embraces the unique characteristics of the sport. We model the scoring rate for each team as its own semi-Markov process, with hazard functions for each process that depend on the players on the ice. This method yields offensive and defensive player ability ratings which take into account quality of teammates and opponents, the game situation, and other desired factors, that themselves have a meaningful interpretation in terms of game outcomes. Additionally, since the number of parameters in this model can be quite large, we make use of two different shrinkage methods depending on the question of interest: full Bayesian hierarchical models that partially pool parameters according to player position, and penalized maximum likelihood estimation to select a smaller number of parameters that stand out as being substantially different from average. We apply the model to all five-on-five (full-strength) situations for games in five NHL seasons."

In this work, we introduce the first public framework to evaluate spatial and trajectory tracking data of players relative to a baseline distribution of “ghost” defenders. We demonstrate our framework in the context of modeling the nearest defender positioning at the moment of catch. In particular, we provide estimates of how much better or worse their observed positioning and trajectory compared to the expected play value of ghost defenders. Our framework leverages high-dimensional tracking data features through flexible random forests for conditional density estimation in two ways: (1) to model the distribution of receiver yards gained enabling the estimation of within-play expected value, and (2) to model the 2D spatial distribution of baseline ghost defenders. We present novel metrics for measuring player and team performance based on tracking data, and discuss challenges that remain in extending our framework to other aspects of American football."

Due to the growing number of participants, the organization of limited staff, equipment, and medical support in these races now plays a key role. Monitoring runner’s performance is a difficult task that requires knowledge of the terrain and of the runner’s ability. In the past, choices were solely based on the organizers’ experience without reliance on data. However, this approach is neither scalable nor transferable. Instead, we propose a firm statistical methodology to perform this task, both before and during the race. Our proposed framework, Trail Running Assessment of Performance (TRAP), studies (1) the assessment of the runner’s ability to reach the next checkpoint, (2) the prediction of the runner’s expected passage time at the next checkpoint, and (3) corresponding prediction intervals for the passage time. We apply our methodology, using the race history of runners from the International Trail Running Association (ITRA) along with checkpoint and terrain-level information, to the “holy grail” of ultra-trail running, the Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc (UTMB) race, demonstrating the predictive power of our methodology."

In this paper, we connect four big ideas that are common across multiple sports: the expected value of a game state, win probability, measures of team strength, and the use of sports betting market data. For each, we explore both the shared similarities and individual idiosyncrasies of analytical approaches in each sport. While our focus is on the concepts underlying each type of analysis, any implementation necessarily involves statistical methodologies, computational tools, and data sources. Where appropriate, we outline how data, models, tools, and knowledge of the sport combine to generate actionable insights. We also describe opportunities to share analytical work, but omit an in-depth discussion of individual player evaluation as beyond our scope. This paper should serve as a useful overview for anyone becoming interested in the study of sports analytics."

Existing methods for player evaluation in football depend heavily on proprietary data, are not reproducible, and lag behind those of other major sports. We present four contributions to the study of football statistics in order to address these issues. First, we develop the R package nflscrapR to provide easy access to publicly available play-by-play data from the National Football League (NFL) dating back to 2009. Second, we introduce a novel multinomial logistic regression approach for estimating the expected points for each play. Third, we use the expected points as input into a generalized additive model for estimating the win probability for each play. Fourth, we introduce our nflWAR framework, using multilevel models to isolate the contributions of individual offensive skill players, and providing estimates for their individual wins above replacement (WAR). We estimate the uncertainty in each player’s WAR through a resampling approach specifically designed for football, and we present these results for the 2017 NFL season. We discuss how our reproducible WAR framework, built entirely on publicly available data, can be easily extended to estimate WAR for players at any position, provided that researchers have access to data specifying which players are on the field during each play. Finally, we discuss the potential implications of this work for NFL teams."
