With the introduction of player tracking data from the NFL, researchers can now tackle these problems. However, event and strategy annotations in the NFL’s tracking data are limited, especially when it comes to describing what defensive players do on each play. Moreover, methods for creating these annotations typically require extensive human labeling, which is difficult and expensive. Because of the importance of the passing game and the limited prior research on the defensive side of passing, we provide annotations for the pass coverage types of cornerbacks using unsupervised learning techniques, which require no training data. We define a set of features from the tracking data that distinguish between “man” and “zone” coverage. We use mixture models to create clusters corresponding to each group, allowing us to provide probabilistic assignments to each coverage type (or cluster). Additionally, we quantify each feature’s influence in distinguishing defensive pass coverage types. Our work makes possible several potential avenues of future NFL research into defensive backs and pass coverage strategies.\n\n",
