In this work, we introduce the first public framework to evaluate spatial and trajectory tracking data of players relative to a baseline distribution of \"ghost\" defenders. We demonstrate our framework in the context of modeling the nearest defender positioning at the moment of catch. In particular, we provide estimates of how much better or worse their observed positioning and trajectory compared to the expected play value of ghost defenders. Our framework leverages high-dimensional tracking data features through flexible random forests for conditional density estimation in two ways: (1) to model the distribution of receiver yards gained enabling the estimation of within-play expected value, and (2) to model the 2D spatial distribution of baseline ghost defenders. We present novel metrics for measuring player and team performance based on tracking data, and discuss challenges that remain in extending our framework to other aspects of American football.\n\n![](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.17220v1/extracted/5689269/figures/ex_play_epv_grid.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=65%}\n\n",
