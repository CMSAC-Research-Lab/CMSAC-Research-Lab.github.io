Welcome to the home page of the [Carnegie Mellon Sports Analytics Center (CMSAC)](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/cmsac/) Research Lab. We are a group of faculty and students in the [Department of Statistics & Data Science at Carnegie Mellon University](https://stat.cmu.edu/) that are developing novel, cutting-edge approaches in sports analytics across a wide range of problems. We have recently been focused on inferring player- and team-level effects with rich spatio-temporal data.
